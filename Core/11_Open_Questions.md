The V7 Reflective-Ethical Engine (REE) architecture, though proposed as a coherent and biologically grounded model, raises numerous open questions and faces substantial theoretical and empirical challenges. These questions primarily revolve around formal validation, implementation feasibility, and the completeness of its structural model of the human mind.

The open questions can be broadly categorized into three areas: Conceptual and Formal Gaps, Architectural and Engineering Gaps, and Empirical and Falsification Questions.

1. Conceptual and Formal Gaps

The primary open questions concern the architectural foundations and the rigorous grounding of its core principles:

• **Necessity vs. Sufficiency of Ethical Axioms:** The ethical foundations of V7 are based on five axioms, including "Love exists" and "Uncertainty about what is best". However, the necessity and sufficiency of these axioms are **unresolved**. There is no rigorous argument that a system lacking one axiom must be ethically pathological, nor that a system realizing all five will be fully aligned in practice.

• **Formal Grounding:** V7 still **lacks a single core formalism** (F_core) for ψ-inference and ethics. Although various partial formalisms exist (symbolic, modal, probabilistic), they lack a unifying semantic mapping, making claims about "love-aligned behavior" ill-posed.

• **Anthropomorphism Risk:** The V7 ethical structure is closely tuned to human phenomenology and reflective practice, which poses a risk of **anthropomorphism**. It is unclear if non-human minds would arrive at the same ethical basin, leading to concerns that the architecture may only mirror the human reflective process.

• **Underdetermination of Architecture:** Even if V7 fits many neurobiological and clinical facts, this is a well-known problem in theory-building, meaning many **other architectures could fit the same data** (e.g., simpler predictive processing variants). This raises the question of whether V7 is reifying a convenient decomposition rather than identifying _the_ fundamental decomposition.

• **Terminology and Parsimony:** The extensive use of concepts like "Braidling," "Cognifold," and ψ-fields adds scaffolding but risks obscuring the cognitive simplicity beneath, making the overall corpus difficult to enter for external researchers.

2. Architectural and Engineering Gaps

Even when framed as a model of the human mind, V7 has specific, under-specified architectural components that must be formalized, particularly concerning computational implementation:

• **Working Memory (WM) Specification:** The architecture assumes recursion but **lacks a concrete specification for where the "scratchpad" or working memory lives**. WM is critical for chaining recursive reflections and long-horizon ethical reasoning.

• **Habit Systems and Procedural Control:** V7 currently focuses heavily on model-based, reflective processes but must account for **model-free habit loops** (procedural control) that compete with the reflective ethical loop, analogous to Cortico-Striato-Thalamo-Cortical loops in procedural learning.

• **Resource and Capacity Management:** V7 lacks a **"RESOURCE / CAPACITY" dimension** to model energy budget, glia, or neurovascular coupling, which are crucial for clinical phenomena like cognitive fog, delirium, and fatigue.

• **Meta-Loops and Regulation:** Although V7 has components for mode control (RAS), it requires explicit formalization of several meta-loops, which are necessary for stable, human-like cognition:

    ◦ **Prediction-Error-of-Prediction Loop (META-1):** The mechanism by which the system evaluates if its models are too rigid or updating too much, which is central to insight and doubt.

    ◦ **Self-Model Update Loop (META-2):** A dedicated mechanism for updating the self-prior.

    ◦ **Long-Horizon Planning (W₁₀/Composite Mode):** A mechanism for building temporally extended, hierarchical plans, necessary for life projects and narratives spanning years/decades.

• **Developmental Staging:** The architecture must incorporate **formal developmental staging** to model how the mind emerges (infancy, attachment learning, adolescence divergence, adult refinement), as brains do not appear fully formed.

• **Structural Redundancy and Inefficiency:** Treating V7 as an evolved, messy mind necessitates defining which components are **truly essential** for a Minimal Viable Mind (MVM) versus those that are redundant but critical for robustness, social behaviour, or endophenotypes.

3. Empirical and Falsification Questions

The architecture requires specific experimental outcomes to support its claims, particularly regarding the poly-world-model theory of affect and the structure of latent spaces:

• **Affective Mapping Validation:** The model predicts that **every universal emotion emerges from characteristic patterns of prediction errors in specific world models** (W₁–W₈). The open question is whether empirical evidence supports the predicted clustering of emotional expressions according to the specific World-Model error type.

• **Guardrail Functions:** Does empirical evidence confirm that certain affective expressions, such as laughter or crying, function as **policy constraint systems** or "hard-coded guardrails" that reshape the agent's action policy to enforce social cohesion or prevent misalignment?.

• **Latent Space Dimensionality and Flow:** A major open question is whether information flowing through the brain's oscillatory bands (gamma → delta) shows **progressive dimensionality reduction**. The model predicts that fast bands carry high-dimensional codes while slow bands carry low-dimensional, summary-like codes.

• **Theta Band Orchestration:** Does evidence show that the **theta band functions as a global coherence orchestrator** in both sleep and waking states, consistent with the L₃/L₄ transition and memory consolidation roles?.

• **Clinical Endophenotype Clustering:** If V7's mapping of psychiatric disorders to specific loop failures is correct, future studies should confirm that clinical subtypes cluster according to **predicted loop failure patterns** (endophenotypes) and that these subtypes **predict differential treatment responses**. If cluster structure is weak or treatment responses do not align with loop types, the V7 psychiatric mapping would be undermined.

• **Cerebellar–Cortical Shared Manifolds:** Empirical testing is needed to determine if the **cerebellum and cortex share a latent subspace** for trajectory and predictive data, consistent with the dual world-model architecture (W₁/Static and W₂/Dynamic).
