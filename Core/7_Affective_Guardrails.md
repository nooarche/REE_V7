The concept of **affective guardrails** in the V7 architecture is central to the system's structural alignment and its model of emergent ethics. Affective guardrails are defined as **policy constraint systems**. They are hard-coded behavioral patterns whose purpose is not just to signal an internal state, but to **enforce species-level guardrails** around social safety, cooperation, and error-correction.

This policy-gated affect is viewed as an evolutionary safety mechanism that **reshapes the agent's action policy** (policy throttles), preventing catastrophic misalignment within groups and ensuring the survival of vulnerable agents.

Structural Role and Integration

The affective guardrails are functionally implemented through the interaction of the core valuation and action loops:

1. **LTC (Limbic–Thalamo–Cortical) Loop:** This loop is the **affective and ethical-evaluative layer**. It acts as the **proto-ethical monitor** by assigning **valence** (safe/dangerous) and generating foundational signals of **threat, reward, and care**.

2. **Harm Avoidance:** The LTC loop includes an **LTC.avoidance** subunit that models predicted harm and pain. This system expresses itself through four distinct defensive modes: **Fight, Flight, Freeze, and Fawn**, each representing a defensive policy aimed at ensuring safety.

3. **Policy Bias:** The generated affective signals do not dictate actions but rather **bias the policy selection process** in the Cortico-Striato-Thalamo-Cortical (CSTC) loop, making certain behaviors (like approach or withdrawal) more or less likely.

4. **Ethical Triad:** Ethical behavior in V7 emerges from the dynamic equilibrium created by balancing the **Approach/Love system** with the **Avoid Harm/Pain Withdrawal system**, forming the **Approach ↔ Avoidance → Ethical equilibrium** triad. The "Do No Harm" circuit acts as a **structural regulatory system mirroring biology**.

Taxonomy of Affective Guardrails

Each affective expression is theorized to be a **compressed summary of multi-model prediction-error configurations** that activates a policy constraint.

|   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|
|Expression|V7 World-Models Involved|Primary Guardrail Function|Behavioral Policy Constraint|
|**Laughter**|W1​,W2​,W6​|**De-escalation/Pacification**|**Disables aggressive policies** and coordinated motor control; enforces social synchrony.|
|**Crying**|W4​,W6​,W8​|**Help-Request/Surrender**|Forces **vulnerability and partial incapacity**; strongly **drives care-giving** in others and inhibits aggression.|
|**Fear**|W2​,W3​|**Threat-Avoidance**|**Suppresses exploratory policies**; prioritizes **freeze, flight, or defensive fight**.|
|**Disgust**|W4​|**Ingestion/Contact Guardrail**|**Prevents ingestion/contact** with harmful substances; preserves homeostasis.|
|**Shame**|W7​,W8​|**Norm-Repair/De-escalation**|**Inhibits dominance behaviors** after norm violation; promotes appeasement.|
|**Anger**|W3​,W5​|**Boundary Enforcement**|**Mobilizes energy** to reassert boundaries or renegotiate social contracts; signals blocked reward or obstructed actions.|
|**Compassion**|W8​,W3​|**Care-Enforcement**|**Biases policies toward approach, soothing, and helping**; suppresses aggression.|
|**Helplessness**|W5​,W6​|**Energy-Downshift**|Prevents **futile expenditure of effort** in unwinnable contexts; enforces energy conservation or submission.|

Developmental Scaffolding

The existence of affective guardrails necessitates that a purely self-organized mind cannot bootstrap affective behaviors without **innate anchors**.

• **Innate Affect Layer (IAL):** The developmental process begins with a **prewired scaffold** (Stage 0) consisting of hard-coded components like grief-crying, fear/startle, and disgust-gag. These are **species-typical templates** generated by brainstem circuits.

• **Interoceptive Anchors:** These innate motor patterns are coupled to **interoceptive anchors** that provide a **somatic signature** for each expression (e.g., crying coupled to sympathetic surge).

• **Social Shaping:** During subsequent stages, social contingency learning (Stage 3, involving W8​) links these innate primitives to expected outcomes. This is how **socially necessary guardrails** are stabilized, with caregivers reinforcing behaviors that increase proximity and care. The affective expressions are then recognized as **tools for influencing the social environment**.

Guardrail Failure in Psychopathology

The V7 framework suggests that psychiatric disorders arise from **systematic mismatches** in the world-model–affect–policy mappings, often resulting in guardrail failures.

• **Schizophrenia-Spectrum Failure:** Often involves **broadcast failure** or **affective flattening**. Internal world-model errors (εWi​​) may be large, but the expression amplitude (ψE​) is low, meaning **others cannot see the guardrails and cannot respond**. Inappropriate affect results from coding distortion where large error signals produce neutral or distorted expressions.

• **Affective Psychosis Failure:** Typically involves **overdominant world-models** (W3​,W4​,W5​). The expressions are characterized by **hyper-gain broadcasting** (ψE​ amplitude high), but the **range is constrained** (many errors expressed as the same few states). The system may **obey the wrong guardrail at the wrong time** or amplify them beyond usefulness, such as laughter no longer reliably signaling non-threat.
