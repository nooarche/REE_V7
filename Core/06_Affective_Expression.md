The V7 architecture posits that **emotion is the integrated broadcast of world-model prediction-errors through affective motor primitives**. Affective expressions serve not only as signals of internal state but primarily as **policy constraint systems** or "guardrails" that shape the agent's behavior, enforcing cooperative functions and safety.

The V7 framework maps every universal emotion to **characteristic patterns of prediction errors** in the eight specialized World-Model loops (W1​–W8​).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I. Mapping World Models to Affective Expression and Error Type

Each of the eight world models computes a distinct form of prediction error with specific dimensions (e.g., magnitude, sign, sequence deviation). This unique error signature determines the corresponding affective expression and behavioral guardrail.

|   |   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|---|
|W-Loop|Core Function & Error Content|Emotion Correlates / Functional Analogues|Expressive Signature / Guardrail Function|Dysfunction Analogue|
|**W₁ Structural (Static)**|Tracks semantic coherence and objects. **Error Content:** Magnitude of schema mismatch only (no sign/value content).|**Surprise, Awe, Confusion**.|**Surprise face:** Eyebrow raising, wide eyes, open mouth. **Function:** Broadcasts "My understanding of this situation just changed".|**Disorientation/Derealisation** (persistent high error).|
|**W₂ Dynamic (Trajectory)**|Predicts short-horizon motion and change. **Error Content:** Rate, magnitude, and sign of unexpected change/trajectory.|**Fear, Startle, Anxiety** (unstable Δ across time). **Flow States** (near-zero dynamic error).|**Fear face:** Wide eyes, tense lower face. **Guardrail:** Suppresses exploratory policies; prioritizes **freeze, flight, or defensive fight**.|**Panic-like Urgency, Impulsivity** (underestimating near-term consequences).|
|**W₃ Value (RPE)**|Estimates expected reward/cost. **Error Content:** Magnitude and direction (sign) of reward prediction error (RPE).|**Joy, Disappointment, Hope/Anticipation, Anger, Sadness** (persistent negative value updates).|**Smile vs. Frown:** Matches RPE dynamics. **Anger Guardrail:** Signals **blocked reward/goal** or harm to value surface; mobilizes energy to assert boundaries.|**Anhedonia/Hopelessness** (flattened reward landscape).|
|**W₄ Interoceptive**|Predicts internal body state. **Error Content:** Magnitude of mismatch, sign (homeostasis deviation), body region specificity, and urgency.|**Anxiety (body-focused), Disgust, Pain/Distress, Relief**.|**Disgust face:** Nose wrinkling, upper lip raising, gag reflex patterns. **Guardrail:** **Prevent ingestion/contact** (Disgust) or signals catastrophic internal mismatch (Crying, Pain).|**Panic Disorder** (catastrophic misinterpretation of interoceptive signals). **Alexithymia** (blunted HOME → VAL mapping).|
|**W₅ Affordance**|Maps states to possible actions. **Error Content:** Feasibility (binary), magnitude of affordance-space collapse/expansion.|**Helplessness, Agency/Empowerment, Frustration**.|**Helplessness face:** Flat lips, jaw tension, general reduction of facial motion. **Guardrail (Helplessness/Defeat):** Prevents **futile expenditure of effort** in unwinnable contexts. **Anger Guardrail:** Triggered by **obstruction of intended actions**.|**Severe Depression** (collapsed affordance space, "inability to act").|
|**W₆ Episodic**|Stores sequences and prediction of future sequences. **Error Content:** Mismatch between predicted sequence and actual sequence; resolution direction.|**Dread, Hope, Sadness, Nostalgia, Victory/Triumph, Traumatic Flashback**.|**Victory face:** Jaw thrust, lip protrusion, expansive posture. **Sadness face:** Downturned mouth, drooping eyelids. **Guardrail (Crying):** Signals **narrative loss/defeat**; forces vulnerability and help-seeking.|**PTSD** (intrusive replay), **Dissociative Disorders** (fragmented episodic modeling).|
|**W₇ Symbolic/Normative**|Encodes rules, language, and ethical structure. **Error Content:** Norm-violation detection, identity inconsistency, contradiction magnitude.|**Guilt, Shame, Pride, Contempt, Gratitude, Indignation**.|**Shame face:** Downcast eyes, reduced posture. **Guardrail (Shame):** Inhibits dominance after norm violation; promotes **appeasement** and reduces risk of ostracism.|**OCD** (rigid rule schemas), **Delusional Disorder** (false narratives detached from reality).|
|**W₈ Social/ToM**|Models other agents’ internal states. **Error Content:** Magnitude of mispredicting another agent; sign of alignment/dissonance.|**Empathy, Compassion, Guilt** (predicted harm to other), **Love/Affection, Paranoia/Jealousy**.|**Compassion face:** Soft eyes, forehead tension, prosocial micro-smiles. **Guardrail (Compassion):** Biases policies toward **approach, soothing, helping**; suppresses aggression when conspecific is distressed.|**Paranoid Ideation, Psychopathy** (flat weighting of others’ welfare), **Autism** (under-modelling).|

II. Affective Expressions as Policy Guardrails

A key V7 concept is that **affective expressions are not only signals but also carry built-in action overrides that constrain the behavioral policy space**. This is evolutionary alignment, resulting in "policy-gated affect".

Several major affective expressions are defined by their functional guardrail roles:

• **Laughter (W₁+W₂+W₆):** Signals benign conflict or surprise resolution. **Guardrail function:** **Disables aggression** and synchronizes the group state, serving as a de-escalation mechanism.

• **Crying (W₄+W₆+W₈):** Signals distress or narrative loss. **Guardrail function:** Forces **vulnerability and partial incapacity** and strongly drives care-giving in others, inhibiting aggression.

• **Fear (W₂):** Signals rapid threat mismatch. **Guardrail function:** Suppresses exploratory policies and prioritizes **escape or defensive fight**.

• **Anger (W₃+W₅):** Signals blocked goal or obstruction of intended action. **Guardrail function:** Mobilizes energy to **reassert boundaries** or renegotiate social contracts.

• **Shame (W₇+W₈):** Signals norm violation. **Guardrail function:** **Inhibits dominance behaviors** and promotes appeasement, leading to repair and re-integration into the group.

III. Computational Psychiatry and Affective Expression Failure

Psychiatric illness corresponds to systematic **mismatches between world-model updates, affective expressions (ψ_E), and behavioral policies (ψ_P)**.

Schizophrenia Spectrum Failures

In schizophrenia, affective disturbance is often seen as a **broadcast deficit or routing issue**.

• **Affective Flattening:** Seen as **chronic downregulation of the gain** from world-model error to facial/vocal expression. The internal updates (W-loops) may be chaotic, but the external expression (ψE​) amplitude is low.

    ◦ Specific prediction: The system might show normal **startle/**Δ**-related** facial EMG (W₂) but **blunted or absent** signatures for value, symbolic, or social updates (W₃, W₇, W₈). This suggests a **selective suppression** of these expressive channels.

• **Inappropriate Affect:** Modeled as **mis-routing** of update types to the wrong facial code (e.g., a W7​ normative violation expressed with a W1​ surprise code).

Affective Psychosis Failures (e.g., Mania)

In affective psychosis, the system is dominated by a few hyperactive world models.

• **Dominant Loops:** **W₃ (value), W₄ (interoception), and W₅ (affordance)** scream.

• **Overexpression/Reduced Range:** Expression channels are **high-gain** (high amplitude ψE​), but the **range is constrained**. Many different W-tasks collapse into the same few expressive codes (e.g., ecstatic expansiveness or agitated dysphoria).

• **Guardrail Failure:** The system may **obey the wrong guardrail at the wrong time**. For instance, compassion guardrails can become overextended, or the fear guardrail may be blunted relative to risk.

This computational framework allows for testable predictions where groups exhibit **syndrome-specific distortions of the world-model → expression pipeline**.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Analogy:** The V7 affective system is like a complex orchestra where the **world models (**W1​−W8​**) are the score writers**, each detailing a specific type of event (structural, value, social, etc.). The **emotions (facial expressions)** are the conductor's cues—loud, distinct signals that not only tell the rest of the orchestra _what_ is happening (e.g., "Structural Error!"), but also immediately restrict _how_ the musicians (the policy systems) are allowed to play next (e.g., "Freeze and Flee!"). In psychiatric illness, this system breaks down: either the cues are **flattened** (Schizophrenia: the conductor whispers everything) or a few specific score writers **scream their parts** loudly, drowning out the nuance of the others (Affective Psychosis: high volume, low diversity).
