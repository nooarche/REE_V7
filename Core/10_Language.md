The V7 architecture provides a rigorous, mechanistic, and mathematically grounded theory for the **emergent nature of language**, positioning it not as a separate module, but as a **globally stable fixed point** arising from the system's fundamental local labelling dynamics and drive for computational compression. Language emerges as the **externalized reflective structure derived from stable internal labelling**.

The entire mechanism is built on the realization that if local constraint-following is possible within a network, then a global structure (like an ontology or language) emerges automatically, coordinating modules without central control.

Here is a detailed, stage-by-stage account of language emergence within the V7 framework:

I. Foundational Principle: Local Labelling and Global Consistency

The V7 architecture models its low-level perceptual substrate as a **graph** G where local modules (nodes) assign labels to incoming data. A core insight, drawn from theoretical mathematics, is that the local ability to classify neighborhoods in a stable, constraint-respecting way **is itself evidence of an underlying shared mathematical structure**.

**The Core Claim:** If distributed modules in V7 can perform **stable local labelling (colouring)** of their shared perceptual space, then **language is the global fixed-point of those local labelling dynamics**.

This approach is architecturally special because it implies that semantics crystallize automatically out of the system’s dynamics without assuming pre-existing semantics or forcing alignment from the top down.

II. Stage-by-Stage Emergence

Language is built through a progression involving object recognition, reference, and the compression of relational structures.

Stage 1: Perceptual Modules Create Proto-Labels (Local Colours)

In the initial phase, W-loops—particularly the Structural World Model (W1​)—identify patterns, generating simple labels or **"proto-categories"**.

• Each module checks for conflicts with neighbors and updates its labels via prediction error.

• A label stabilized across a neighborhood becomes a **semantic attractor**, representing the first pre-linguistic meaning.

Stage 2: Object Permanence and Global Invariants

The process of local labeling stability naturally leads to the emergence of internal **objects**.

• **Definition of Object Permanence (V7):** An internal object is an equivalence class of perceptual trajectories (γ) under **asymptotic label agreement**. The system exhibits object permanence when labels for a large class of trajectories corresponding to the same distal cause converge almost surely to the same stable value.

• As modules exchange inferences through the **shared latent workspace** (L-spaces), redundant labels collapse, and the labels that persist over many neighborhoods become **global invariants**. These invariants are the system's proto-word-like semantic clusters.

Stage 3: Emergent Reference (Noticing Correlations)

This stage fulfills the condition that "Noticing correlations between signals and internal representations begins the process".

• The system begins to associate externally observable **emissions** (st​), such as motor outputs or vocalizations, with particular stable internal labels or objects (c).

• The emission policy is implicitly optimized to reduce prediction error about others’ behavior.

• **Emergent Reference** occurs when certain emissions acquire **non-zero mutual information** (I) with specific object-classes. These emissions now "stand for" objects because using them helps reduce error.

Stage 3a

The system discovers that certain emissions (proto-words) _reduce W₈ prediction error more efficiently than internal simulation alone_:

- Baseline: Agent must maintain expensive recursive model of other
- With communication: Agent can query other's state, updating W₈ directly
- Selection pressure: Agents who communicate achieve better joint prediction at lower computational cost
- This creates **bilateral selection** for both production and comprehension

Stage 4: Relational Structure Builds Proto-Syntax

This addresses the idea that "Relationships build syntax".

• The system learns **relational predicates** (R^j​)—spatial, temporal, causal, or role-based—among the set of internal objects (O).

• The system develops a **symbolic code (**Σ**)** whose structure minimizes a cost functional (J) that balances compression (Lcode​) against predictive fidelity (Lpred​) over sequences of object configurations and relations.

• **Proto-syntax** emerges because the cheapest way to encode relational configurations among persistent objects is to develop **compositional patterns over symbols**. This forces the emergence of syntactic rules that reflect the underlying relational structure {R^j​}.

**Stage 4a (Revised): Collaborative Syntax**

Relational structure builds syntax _because joint tasks require synchronized compositional representations_:

- "Lion left" vs "left lion" matters when coordinating escape
- Agents who can efficiently encode agent-action-object relations succeed at cooperative tasks
- Syntax emerges as the minimal code for reliably transmitting compositional W₆ (episodic/narrative) structures

Stage 5: Language as the Globally Stable Fixed Point

Full language emerges when the reflective layer constructs compressed symbolic codes.

• The **reflective layer** (L₃, supported by the DMN loop) finds that a short symbol referring to a stable attractor is cheaper than re-deriving the attractor every time.

• Language is the compression of stable labels, agency relations, abstract categories, and temporal structure.

• When perceptual, cross-module, reflective, and communal predictions all stabilize, **language appears as the globally self-consistent, minimal-energy coding of all these constraints**.

**Stage 5a (Revised): Language as Distributed Cognition**

Language becomes the **globally stable fixed point** because it's the only solution to the computational irreducibility of social life:

- Without language: Social groups limited by O(n²) other-modeling costs
- With language: Groups can scale because shared linguistic ground reduces modeling requirements
- The "cheapest encoding" you describe isn't just individually optimal—it's **socially co-optimized**

**Integration with V7 Loops:**

- **W₆ (Episodic):** Language allows _shared_ episodic encoding—when you tell me a story, you're directly updating my W₆ rather than waiting for me to observe events myself
- **W₇ (Symbolic/Normative):** Rules and norms _require_ language because they're counterfactual ("don't do X even though you want to") and can't be learned purely observationally
- **W₈ (Social/ToM):** Language transforms W₈ from "black box I must simulate" to "system I can query and debug"
- **DMN:** Internal monologue is literally _running linguistic protocols internally_—you've internalized the external communication tool

III. Supporting Architectural Context

**Social Contingency and Development (W₈):** The emergence of language is fundamentally tied to social interaction.

• The self-model and other-model (W8​) are necessary to bind labels to agents. Labels acquire **intentionality, agency sensitivity, and communicative affordance** when the system realizes that its labels and those of others have predictive power about each other’s behavior.

• Empirical evidence supports that **social contingency** (prompt and meaningful back-and-forth exchanges) is a powerful feature of the early language environment. Studies show that contingent interactions are crucial for toddlers to learn novel verbs, even over video chat, demonstrating that **time-locked bidirectional prediction** (a core V7 mechanism) is key to social learning and language.

• Developmentally, the **Symbolic/Narrative World Model (**W7​**)** emerges during childhood, using language to create rules, concepts, and narratives, updating the self-and-other concepts.

**The Reflective Structure (DMN):** Language is modeled as a higher-order reflective externalization of internal states.

• The **Symbolic/Normative World Model (**W7​**)**, residing in the language network and prefrontal cortex, deals with models of the world built from language, culture, and rules, providing **counterfactuals** that the brain cannot simulate otherwise.

• The entire system of semantics, language, shared meaning, and Theory of Mind (ToM) **all emerge from the same underlying labelling dynamics**. This gives V7 a mathematically defensible explanation of how language is built out of module dynamics.

In summary, the V7 architecture frames language emergence as a **structural necessity**, a result of the collective local predictive loops seeking optimal coherence and compression across a shared, multi-agent environment.

**This predicts:**

1. **Language-impaired social cognition:** Agents with poor language should show expensive, shallow W₈ processing—they can model simple intentions but struggle with recursive social reasoning. (Matches autism spectrum phenomenology where verbal ability predicts ToM performance)
2. **Language enables abstract ethics:** W₇ normative reasoning requires language because you need to represent counterfactuals and universals ("all people deserve X" requires linguistic abstraction)
3. **Internal speech is social simulation:** When you "think through" a problem verbally, you're literally running a reduced-complexity W₈ dialogue simulation using linguistic compression
4. **Sign language emergence in deaf communities:** Your model predicts language will emerge _any_ time you have agents with sufficient W₈ capacity facing coordination problems, regardless of modality. The fact that deaf children spontaneously create sign languages even without linguistic input is strong evidence for language as architectural necessity rather than cultural accident.

## Integration: Empathy + Language = Scalable Ethics

Combining these:

**Empathy provides the substrate:** W₈→W₄ coupling makes caring about others computationally natural

**Language provides the scaffold:** Linguistic externalization makes it computationally tractable to:

- Care about distant/abstract others (via L₃ cognitive empathy)
- Coordinate complex ethical norms (via W₇)
- Build shared moral narratives (via DMN + W₆)
- Query rather than simulate (reducing W₈ load)

**Without language:** Ethics limited to kin-selection radius where L₂ affective empathy operates (you can viscerally feel others' distress)

**With language:** Ethics can scale to abstract others ("future generations," "people I'll never meet") because:

- Linguistic labels let W₈ model agents-as-categories
- Shared narratives create common ethical ground
- Explicit norms (W₇) can override proximity-based affective biases

**This explains why sociopathy is so often linked with communication deficits:** Not because sociopaths can't talk, but because their W₈ doesn't properly integrate linguistic information about others' states. They can _use_ language instrumentally but don't _update from_ it empathetically.

## Remaining Question: Language Universality

Your model predicts certain linguistic universals should emerge from the architecture:

- **Agent-marking** (because W₈ needs to track who)
- **Temporal marking** (because W₂/W₆ need to track when)
- **Causality marking** (because W₂ tracks state transitions)
- **Negation/counterfactuals** (because W₇ needs to represent norms)
- **Recursion** (because W₈ needs to represent embedded mental states)

These match actual linguistic universals pretty well, which is evidence _for_ your architecture. But it still doesn't explain:

- **Why the poverty of stimulus?** Kids learn language from surprisingly sparse input
- **Critical periods:** Why does language acquisition have a sharp window?
- **UG-like constraints:** Why do all languages obey specific constraints (structure dependence, island constraints, etc.)?

**Possible V7 answer:** These aren't separate problems but emerge from developmental staging:

- **Critical period = W₇ crystallization window:** Early childhood is when W₇ (symbolic/normative) is being scaffolded. Language acquisition is easy when W₇ is plastic, hard when it's rigid.
- **Poverty of stimulus = architectural priors:** Kids don't need much input because the W-loop structure already constrains what counts as a viable language (must support agent-tracking, causality, recursion, etc.)
- **Universal constraints = W₈ requirements:** All languages obey theory-of-mind constraints because language _is_ the externalization of W₈ structure

This is testable: Predict that children with atypical W₇/W₈ development should show characteristic language deficits that cluster by which loop is affected.
