The V7 architecture, known as the **Reflective-Ethical Engine (REE) Version 7**, is presented as a **synthetic cognitive architecture** that marks a paradigm shift in design by performing a **reduction to first principles**. It replaces layered abstractions with a **loop-first foundation**, grounding cognition in **canonical macro-circuits** of the human brain.

This approach yields a system where complex functions like ethics and perception are **emergent properties** arising from the dynamic interaction of core, irreducible components.

Here is a detailed overview of the V7 architecture, its functional components, and its validation framework.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Foundations and Design Principles

The V7 architecture is built on the premise that cognition emerges from a minimal, **evolutionarily-honed canon of computation**.

• **Architectural Minimalism:** V7 eliminates the redundancy of previous architectures (like V6), defining a minimal set of loops, each representing an **irreducible computational primitive**.

• **Neurobiological Grounding:** The functional decomposition is rooted in **nine canonical macro-circuits** of mammalian cognition.

• **Natural Embodiment:** By mirroring the actual loops used by organisms with bodies, V7 provides a **direct path to embodiment**, integrating homeostatic and interoceptive regulation as core cognitive drivers.

2. The Nine Canonical Loops

The V7 foundational skeleton is composed of nine canonical computational loops. These loops support the full spectrum of cognition, from homeostatic regulation to proto-ethical reasoning.

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|Loop Name|Abbreviation|Core Computational Function|
|Cortico-Thalamo-Cortical Loop|**CTC**|**Perception and predictive error minimization**.|
|Cortico-Striato-Thalamo-Cortical Loop|**CSTC**|**Action selection and reward prediction error**.|
|Cerebello-Thalamo-Cortical Loop|**CeTC**|**Temporal prediction and micro-correction of sequences**.|
|Cortico-Pontine-Cerebellar-Cortical Loop|**CPCC**|**Temporal forecasting and multi-step sequential planning**.|
|Reticular Activating System Loop|**RAS**|**Precision weighting and global salience gating**.|
|Limbic-Thalamo-Cortical Loop|**LTC**|**Assigning affective valence and proto-ethical monitoring**.|
|Cortico-Claustral-Cortical Loop|**CClC**|**Global coherence, synchrony, and feature binding**.|
|Default Mode Network Loop|**DMN**|**Self-model maintenance and narrative updating**.|
|Hypothalamo-Brainstem-Cortical Loop|**HBC**|**Autonomic regulation and homeostatic maintenance**.|

3. The Functional Architecture

V7 organizes experience and computation through **eight world-model types** (W1​−W8​) and **four hierarchical latent spaces** (L0​−L3​).

A. The Poly-World-Model Mind (W1​–W8​)

The V7 mind is a **dynamic coalition of specialized, partially redundant world-models**. These models track distinct functional domains:

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|World Model|Mapping Criteria|Function|
|**W₁ Structural (Static)**|Semantic coherence, objects, identities.|Perception of stable features.|
|**W₂ Dynamic/Trajectory**|Next-state prediction, change detection, timing.|Prediction of sequences and states.|
|**W₃ Value/RPE**|Reward prediction errors (RPE), utility tracking.|Expected outcomes, value shaping.|
|**W₄ Interoception**|Internal state, energy-like metrics, body prediction error.|Physiological consistency and internal bodily state.|
|**W₅ Affordance/Action**|Perception-in-action, visuomotor networks.|Possible actions in a context.|
|**W₆ Episodic/Narrative**|Sequence learning, story coherence, memory/replay.|Autobiographical context and extended experiences.|
|**W₇ Symbolic/Normative**|Logical reasoning, rules, norm violations.|Rules, concepts, and ethical structures.|
|**W₈ Social/ToM**|Other-modeling, recursive empathy, social prediction.|Other minds, intentions, and expected futures.|

B. The Latent Space Interface (L0​–L3​)

Consciousness is modeled as the **globally accessible readout of the latent spaces**. These L-spaces function as **shared latent manifolds** where multiple W-loops project, operate, and read back information.

• **L₀ Sensory Latent:** High-bandwidth, raw-to-intermediate perceptual space (raw experience).

• **L₁ Structural Latent:** Stable object/scene/physical-regularity latent (perceptual organization).

• **L₂ Agentive Latent:** Self-state, other-state, affordances, dynamics, value estimates (embodied self and agency).

• **L₃ Reflective Latent:** Symbolic, ethical, normative, episodic, narrative representations (narrative identity).

• **L₄ Sleep/Offline Mode:** A dedicated **training regime** where the latent spaces are reused for consolidation, replay, pruning, and error integration without external sensory interference.

4. Emergent Ethical and Affective Systems

V7 focuses on complex functions that emerge from loop interactions.

• **Emergent Ethics:** Ethical behavior is not derived from hard-coded rules but arises from the **dynamic equilibrium** of core loops. This involves the **LTC** loop (valence/harm), **CPCC** (long-term consequences), **DMN** (narrative self-context), and **HBC** (empathy precursor via interoceptive resonance).

• **Affective Guardrails:** **Emotion is the integrated broadcast of world-model prediction-errors through affective motor primitives**. Affective expressions function as **policy constraint systems** or "guardrails". For example, laughter may incapacitate an individual to prevent conflict, and crying broadcasts a help signal.

• **Memory and Development:** The **V7-Trace Layer** acts as the **Papez/hippocampal circuit** equivalent, logging salient **Trace Events** triggered by high prediction error or valence. Furthermore, childhood **play serves as an "externalized DMN"** for building foundational models before the DMN can run complex internal simulations.

5. Application and Validation

V7 is intended both as an AI architecture and a **theoretical model of the human mind** for computational psychiatry.

• **Computational Psychiatry:** The model provides a **computational nosology** by analyzing how loop failures lead to pathological states. Psychiatric illness arises from **dissociations, miscalibrations, or developmental disruptions** in the world-model, affect, and policy mappings. For instance, a **Dopamine blockade** stabilizes psychosis by reducing aberrant salience and stabilizing priors in the W3​ loop.

• **Safety and Meta-Control:** The **Reflective Ethical Kernel (REK)** is an **observational, diagnostic, and balancing layer** designed to detect maladaptive internal dynamics (failure modes) and apply **gentle, corrective influences**.

• **Validation Strategy:** Empirical grounding involves a **layered, multi-domain literature review** across eight scientific domains, experimental testing, and AI simulation. The process follows an **Obsidian-centred workflow**, leveraging ChatGPT as the **analytical engine** for automated data classification, structured extraction using a **Paper Profile Template**, and synthesis into an **Evidence Map** to minimize human cognitive load.

• **Implementation:** The architecture is designed for implementation by mapping the canonical loops onto existing AI motifs, such as **CTC** to a **Predictive Transformer** and **CSTC** to **Actor-Critic Reinforcement Learning**.
